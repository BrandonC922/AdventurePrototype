A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: 

This game has 4 scenes 
1. Demo1
2. Demo2
3. Room3
4. Room4.


- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: 

3 scenes not part of the adventure game

1. Intro to start the game
2. Logo Scene (SceneA)
3. End of Game where the credits and end screne shows.

- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).

There are 4 rooms that you have to get through.

- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**:

Every room has at least 3 things you can click on that also have messages over them
Every room has something to collect.

 **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: 

Majority if not all objects in the game have a pointerover message
1. Demon in room 2 has a poinrerover message about needing a weapon to beat them
2. Room 4 has a message about a glass case needing to smashed to get something


- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: 

1. Every room has an object that can be picked up on click (Coin in Room 1)
2. Text changes in rooms when objects are clicked. (Boat says on Board when clicked)

- **Some objects are themselves animated**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)

The ghosts (Room 1 and 2) fade in and out when you click or hover over them.
Items fade away when you click them.
The End picture fades in and out.
